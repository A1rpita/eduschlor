# EduScholar Portal: Indian Scholarship Decision Engineeligibility

## 🎓 2025-26 BCA Project Edition
EduScholar Portal is a professional **Decision Support System (DSS)** designed to automate the scholarship  detection process for Indian students. This implementation focuses on high-fidelity Decision Engine logic for the upcoming **2025-26 academic session**.

### 🌟 Project Core Components
**Decision Engine Interface**: A specialized hero-driven homepage ("Indian Scholarship Decision Engine") designed for academic project presentation.
- **Rule-Based Filtering**: The system applies logic-based thresholds for family income, academic marks, and social categories.
- **AI-Powered Grounding**: Uses the Google Gemini API with Search Grounding to verify deadlines and links for the next academic cycle (25-26).
- **Hidden Data Security**: All raw CSV/JSON datasets are internalized, acting as the project's background reference rather than a publicly browsable list.
